## Problem Statement
Startups are growing in India and abroad. With the founders hustling to increase their customer network , meaningful data analysis will help them underdstand their target customers and give them insights on customer retention. But then data analysis and predictive understanding becomes a bit tough for persons in the business side of the organizations .Hiring a data scientist / data analyst or engineers is not always feasible and cost friendly to the new born companies. Whats the solution ?

## Solution

Most importantly custoplus integrates machine learnine pipelines of knn,random forest and svm to predict if any new customer will stay or not based on other
parameters.

## Auto Data Analysis and Auto ml

Auto ml and Auto Data Analysis requires a lot of brainstorming. A solution that works for one dataset may not work for the other . The main challenge we faced was integrating Custoplus to be flexible with all datasets . We have used intelligent solutions in the backend taking parameters like column data type, unique values , nature of values,mean among others to help in automation. Nan Values and outliers have been dealth with in a quite different way . The next problem comes to handle errors when it comes to different types of datasets .

Automatic systems can never replace the human brain. But it can be a cost effective solution to small scale organizations to understand their network before they go on
to hire analysts.
